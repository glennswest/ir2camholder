# IR3 V2 Camera Mount

The camera provided in the IR3 mount is not great.
Designed a replacement mount, that you can pop off the camera, and mount it on 
a flat mount. The mount is designed two m5x6 screws and two standard m5 t-nuts.
Mount it on the rail to the right, near the controller/rasberry pi
